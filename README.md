# Photo Booth Video Viewer

An [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) project. Features a video player that secretly takes photos of the viewers, displays the taken pictures afterwords, followed by a photobooth.

Warning: I made this for an anniversary video for my girlfriend. To see cheesy video, click below.
