# Photo Booth Video Viewer

An [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) project. Features a video player that secretly takes photos of the viewers, displays the taken pictures afterwords, followed by a photobooth.

Warning: I made this for an anniversary video for my girlfriend. To see the cheesy video, click below.

Saved photos found in the output folder of the application.

Created for an anniversary gift.
